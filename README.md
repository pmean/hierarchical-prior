# hierarchical-prior

This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

You will need to have jags software running on your computer 
(http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) and the rjags library.

This program also requires some text files with jags code. These
files are all of the form jags_*.txt.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
